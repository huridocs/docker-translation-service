    "If China adopts an exchange rate regime with multiple currencies and reference rates based on a broad basket of currencies - a policy first proposed by Willem Thorbeck of the Asian Development Bank Institute - the huge surpluses generated within Asia's production networks would drive the region's currencies to appreciate collectively, rather than putting pressure on one or two currencies, as they do today. Market forces would then be able to capitalize on these rises across supply chain countries based on their value added in process trade. This would not only reduce China's surplus and affect China's need to continue accumulating dollar reserves, but could also give Asian companies the incentive to reorient production towards domestic markets.",
